    # Render doesn't natively support "Supabase" as a managed service in the blueprint in the same way it does its own Postgres,
    # but we can define placeholders or just expect the user to fill them. 
    # Actually, for Supabase, we usually just set env vars manually or use a Render PostgreSQL managed database.
    # Given the user specifically asked for "Supabase (database)", I will set up the env vars to be provided manually in the dashboard or via a simplistic internal DB if they change their mind.
    # Re-reading: "use Supabase". Supabase provides a connection string.
    # So I will define them as sync: false (placeholder) so the user is prompted to enter them.
    
databases:
  # If we were using Render's DB, we'd define it here. Since it's Supabase, we just need the app to accept the credentials.
